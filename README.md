# WeChat Automatic reply and other facilitating functions

In my code, I use the library called itchat of python. Then I register a free Turing robot as my baby to reply others for me. But there are still a lot of interesting functions waiting me to code. So if you have any good idea, Dont be mean please, just coding together.Thank you.

another thing is that I didnt provide my own baby's KEY haha, so you have to use yourself or get one in Turing Robot Official Website.
